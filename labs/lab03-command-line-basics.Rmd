## Basic Bash shell commands

The first part of the lab involves navigating the file system and manipulating
files (and directories) with the following basic bash commands:

- `pwd`: print working directory
- `ls`: list files and directories
- `cd`: change directory (move to another directory)
- `mkdir`: create a new directory
- `touch`: create a new (empty) file
- `cp`: copy file(s)
- `mv`: rename file(s)
- `rm`: delete file(s)

If you are using git-bash you don't have the `man` command to see the manual
documentation of other commands. In this case you can check the _man_ pages
online:

[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/index.html](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/index.html)

Write your commands in a text editor (NOT a word processor) and save them in
a text file: e.g. `lab04-gaston-sanchez.txt`


## Your turn

- Create a new directory `stat133-lab04`
- Change to the directory `stat133-lab04`
- Use the command `curl` to download the following text file:
```bash
# the option is the letter O (Not the number 0)
curl -O http://textfiles.com/food/bread.txt
```

- Use the command `ls` to list the contents in your current directory
- Use the command `curl` to download these other text files:
	- http://textfiles.com/food/btaco.txt
	- http://textfiles.com/food/1st_aid.txt
	- http://textfiles.com/food/beesherb.txt
- Use the command `curl` to download the following csv files:
	- http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/forest-fires/forestfires.csv
	- http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/data/Fisher.csv
	- http://web.pdx.edu/~gerbing/data/cars.csv
- Now try `ls -l` to list the contents in your current directory in long format
- Look at the `man` documentation of `ls` to find out how to list the contents in reverse order
- How would you list the contents in long format and by time?
- Inside `stat133-lab04` create a directory `data`
- Change to the directory `data`
- Create a directory `txt-files`
- Create a directory `csv-files`
- Use the command `mv` to move the `bread.txt` file to the folder `txt-files`
- Use the wildcard `*` to move all the text files to the directory `txt-files`
- Use the wildcard `*` to move all the `.csv` files to the directory `csv-files`
- Go back to the parent directory `stat133-lab04`
- Create a directory `copies`
- Use the command `cp` to copy the `bread.txt` file (the one inside the folder 
`txt-files`) to the `copies` directory
- Use the wildcard `*` to copy all the `.txt` files in the directory `copies`
- Use the wildcard `*` to copy all the `.csv` files in the directory `copies`
- Change to the directory `copies`
- Use the command `mv` to rename the file `bread.txt` as `bread-recipe.txt`
- Rename the file `Fisher.csv` as `iris.csv`
- Rename the file `btaco.txt` as `breakfast-taco.txt`
- Change to the parent directory (i.e. `stat133-lab04`)
- Rename the directory `copies` as `copy-files`
- Find out how to use the `rm` command to delete the directory `copy-files`
- List the contents of the directory `txt-files` displaying the results in reverse (alphabetical) order


### Optional challenge

If you are already familiar with the basic bash commands to 
navigate the filesystem (or if you want to expand your R skills), use the R 
functions to manipulate files and directories to perform the exact same tasks
from within R. See `?files` for more information.

- `getwd()`
- `setwd()`
- `download.file()`
- `dir.create()`
- `list.files()`
- `list.dirs()`
- `file.create()`
- `file.copy()`
- `file.rename()`
- `file.remove()`
